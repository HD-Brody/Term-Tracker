# Environment Setup Guide

To fix the authentication issues, you need to set up your Supabase environment variables.

## Steps:

1. **Create a `.env.local` file** in the `frontend` directory with the following content:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
```

2. **Get your Supabase credentials:**
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to Settings > API
   - Copy the "Project URL" and "anon public" key
   - Replace the placeholder values in your `.env.local` file

3. **Restart your development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## What was fixed:

1. **Better error handling** - Now shows specific error messages instead of just alerts
2. **Loading states** - Buttons show loading state and are disabled during operations
3. **Success feedback** - Shows success messages and automatically redirects after login
4. **Improved UI** - Better styling and user experience
5. **Environment variable validation** - Clear error if Supabase credentials are missing
6. **Debug logging** - Console logs to help identify authentication issues

## Testing the fix:

1. Make sure your `.env.local` file is set up correctly
2. Restart the development server
3. Try signing up with a new email
4. Check your email and click the confirmation link
5. Try logging in with your credentials
6. You should see success messages and be redirected to the dashboard

If you still have issues, check the browser console for any error messages.
